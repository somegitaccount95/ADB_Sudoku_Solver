# ADB_Sudoku_Solver

This project is usable but i can improve on preformace and add a few more tweaks, I am not fully satisfied with this result.

This program utilizes ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Open CV, and Pytesseract to read and automatically solve Sudoku puzzles in the Sudoku.com Android app.

This project only works on android with an adb compatible device.
