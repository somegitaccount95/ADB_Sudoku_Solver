# ADB_Sudoku_Solver

This project is usable but i can improve on preformace and add a few more tweaks, I am not fully satisfied with this result.

This program utilizes ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Open CV, and Pytesseract to read and automatically solve Sudoku puzzles in the Sudoku.com Android app.
